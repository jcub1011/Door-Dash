IDEA: 
User selects options from a menu.
They can customize their selections EX: no oinion, extra pickles etc...
They can view their cart to see what they picked, along with any customizations they made.
The can check out, where it will display the total cost (without tax or delivery fee) and items selected.
They can 'pay', and they will recieve a receipt with total cost + tax, delivery fee, and estimated arrival time.
